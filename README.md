<h1 align = "center">Tableau Certification Form</h1>

#### This stores the R Shiny script generates a form to be used as a concept for Tableau Dashboard Certification.  

This originated as a side project for work where a form is used to review a dashboard and the necessary criteria required before pushing it to production.  The data generated by the form is stored in separate CSV files based on a timestamp of submission and serves as a log.  It also has a dummy list of employees that populate who's submitted the form as to keep naming conventions consistent.  

This framework could then be updated with various business requirements, fields and employees as to fit ones needs.
